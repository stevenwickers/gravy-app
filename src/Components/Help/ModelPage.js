                            <p>The Model contains constant property names that represent the data source schema.
                                Properties are naturally named, for example: <i>p_MovieName</i> is the exposed
                                property name for the application while the data source property is
                                named <i>movie_name</i> which is located within the <b>name</b> attribute.
                                Also, notice all property names are prefixed with <b>p_</b>
                                 (lowercase p with underscore). This is because it will be faster to find the
                                property names with <b>IntelliSense. </b></p>

                                    <li><b>name</b> - This is the name of the data source column which
                                        is returned from an API call.
                                    </li>

                                    <li>
                                        <b>type</b> - This is the type of the property within application
                                        an not the type from the data source. Proper types are
                                        String, Number, Dateâ€¦
                                    </li>

                                        <b>sealed</b> - This is an OPTIONAL attribute.
                                        Use this attribute on properties that cannot be modified such as
                                        an ID field. When the model is passed to an API for a PUT operation
                                        all properties with the attribute sealed will be ignored.

                        <p>The Model Container is a referenced object and is exposed via the <a href="#">controller</a>. The
                            properties <b>(this.properties)</b> object variable point to the model file. The reason
                            for this separation is that multiple model containers can use the same
                            model file. If a model container needs additional properties, that are only
                            relevant to the container, then these properties are added under the
                            internal object variable <b>(this.properties_internal)</b>.

                        <h3>The Model Base</h3>
                        <p>The BaseModel file contains a <b>toString()</b> function that will output the model
                            values in a comma delimited string.</p>

                        <p>Although this base class is optional for all Model Contains,
                            this class might be updated in the future with more functionality
                            so it would be good practice to continue to inherit this base class
                            from all Model Containers.
